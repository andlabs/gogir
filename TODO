- .native/.Native() appending is wrong
  ENUM - do not append
  INTERFACE - ?????
  OBJECT - do append
  STRUCT - do not append
  UNION - ?????
- interface object wrapping doesn't actually work
	Arg.GoDecl() actually sends false to GoType(), but sending true causes weird behavior (constructors return the interface type; lists are not converted)
	and Prefix()/Suffix()/listIn() likely don't (and listOut() likely won't the first time if I don't settle this) handle them correctly
	ideally, all objects should be converted to interfaces except
		- all receivers
		- constructor returns
